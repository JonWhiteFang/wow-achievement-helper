When signed in to battle.net should indicate so where the sign-in button is

Also when signed in there should be a list of my characters to choose from

The realm selector should be a dropdown list

Other potential improvements:
- Add more curated strategies (currently only 3 example achievements)
- Mobile responsive polish
- Achievement icons from Blizzard CDN
- Keyboard navigation
